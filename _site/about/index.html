                <p>I am Gaurav, a researcher and educator from India, exploring the expansive realm of machine learning (ML) and human-computer interaction (HCI). My strong foundation in computer science, with an interest in visual arts, has helped me build a knack for image processing and complex data visualization, which I believe can be useful in my research. I am dedicated to advancing the field by approaching laterally, identifying hidden connections, and by making sophisticated data analysis techniques more accessible. In doing so, I am particularly interested in investigating the societal, environmental, and ethical implications within ML and HCI.</p>
<p>In addition to my computer science background, I have also studied Innovation and Experience Design, gaining insightful understanding of creative experimentation with ideas, the role of technology in solving societal challenges, and the political nature of design. From 2008 to 2015, I worked as an independent designer, participating in design competitions and undertaking projects for various international organizations. During this time, I envisioned a long-term journey that I wanted to take with Mathscapes, a space to develop more accessible tools for design and research using maths.</p>
<p>In 2017, my interest in teaching and research led me to become a faculty member at the Srishti-Manipal Institute, where I taught courses and workshops in human-computer interaction, mathematics, and programming at both undergraduate and graduate levels. My experience as a designer and researcher informs my teaching, providing students with a unique perspective on the intersection of design, mathematics, and technology. In 2022, I left Srishti to pursue further studies, continuing to draw from mathematics, computation, and ethics to structure my thoughts, ideas, and projects.</p>
